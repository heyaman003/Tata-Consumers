                Materiality assessment helps us identify and evaluate potential impacts of our operations on
                environmental
                and social aspects, while also allowing us to recognize opportunities.
                <br><br>
                In FY 2021-22, a detailed materiality assessment study was undertaken, guided by both national and
                international standards such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), International
                Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) Framework, prominent ESG assessment platforms, and the National
                Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC - which underpins the BRSR).
                <br><br>
                Through industry trends and market analysis relevant to TCPL, all relevant issue (i.e., universe of
                issues) were identified. TCPL further conducted surveys and engaged stakeholders to identify the
                material issues potentially affecting the business strategy and risks facing our operations and value
                chain.
            </p>
            <p class="col-md-6">
                Internal and external stakeholder inputs, alongside risk and opportunity assessments, were integral in
                determining and prioritising material issues for TCPL. Significant ESG risks identified through
                materiality assessment were integrated into the company's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process,
                mapping it against the company risks. Finally, the material issues were mapped with TCPL's business and
                sustainability strategies, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and presented in a materiality
                matrix denoting their prioritisation.
                <br><br>
                The materiality assessment process has been reviewed and outcomes have been signed off by the CSR &
                Sustainability Committee of the Board and senior management of TCPL. The company plans to conduct the
                assessment once every 3 years to understand the evolving landscape and any changes in stakeholder
                perceptions.

        <h3 class="fw-bold my-3">MANAGING OUR RISKS</h3>
        <div class="row fs-5">
            <p class="col-md-6">
                Risk management plays a critical role in our strategy and the attainment of our long-term objectives. We
                realize that our organisational success is contingent upon our capability to manage risks, and focus on
                opportunities within our business and the markets we operate in. Hence, our integrated risk management
                ensures a comprehensive consideration of all material topics into the risks and opportunities across the
                Company. The identified material issues which may pose a risk or provide an opportunity for our
                business, the reasoning for selecting these issues and the approaches we have adopted to address or
                mitigate these risks, including the associated financial implications, are all detailed in the BRSR.
                <br><br>
                Besides the materiality assessment, we carry out an annual risk evaluation at the Tata Consumer Group
                level. The company has a Risk Management Committee at Board level, which is responsible for the
                supervision and execution of risk mitigation strategies. Our Enterprise Risk Management process also
                integrates sustainability
            </p>
            <p class="col-md-6">
                issues. Risks pertaining to our material topics, including shifting consumer preferences,
                sustainability, and people- related issues are reviewed exhaustively at the Group management level as
                part of our ERM. We have further analysed climate-associated risks and opportunities in line with the
                Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. To understand the risks and
                opportunities that water-related issues pose to our business operations and supply chain, we have also
                conducted water vulnerability assessments.
                <br><br>
                We recognize the significance of these material issues for our company and stakeholders. Therefore, we
                have analysed the most important material issues for our company and our external stake holders. This
                gives us
                a deeper understanding of how effectively our company manages the wider effects of our activities. We
                have outlined our the strategy and progression in dealing with these material issues in this section.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    Enabling access to nutrition is crucial for TCPL to stay competitive and meet evolving consumer
                    demands. By providing access to great-tasting, healthy products, we contribute to addressing issues
                    related to malnutrition and promote healthier eating habits.
                    <br><br>
                    Our analyses of the markets indicate that consumer preferences are shifting towards healthier food
                    options, while regulatory requirements related to nutrition labelling and product formulation are
                    becoming more stringent globally.
                    If not acted upon adequately, this could result in loss of reputation, impacting consumer trust and
                    brand loyalty, thus affecting the company's financial performance.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    We focus on facilitating access to improved nutrition through the introduction of innovative and
                    affordable products alongside consumer education initiatives. Key factors driving this initiative
                    include conscious efforts towards making
                    our existing products healthier, introducing new products/ product lines with enhanced health
                    benefits, policy advocacy, expanding consumer outreach, and enhancing awareness.
                    <br><br>
                    We maintain a dedicated sales and distribution network tailored to extend our reach to both urban
                    and rural consumers across India. We ensure that consumers receive clear and transparent information
                    about our products to make informed choices. In the fiscal year FY 2023-24, we introduced 46 new
                    products, among which 16 specifically cater to health and wellness needs.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    TCPL is committed to the principles of circular economy and improving resource efficiency. Embracing
                    circular economy practices, such as recycling, reusing, and reducing waste, can help achieve cost
                    savings through optimised resource utilisation and reduced raw material procurement expenses.
                    Additionally, this can enhance supply chain resilience by diversifying sourcing options and reducing
                    reliance on
                    finite resources. Not transitioning to a circular economy can pose several risks to our business -
                    these include potential penalties, reputational harm, increased costs, erosion of investor goodwill,
                    declining market share, and failure to meet evolving consumer demands.
                    <br><br>
                    Given the strain on natural resources and escalating material costs, adopting circular economy could
                    help business economics and spur innovation. However, in the current environment, the lack of
                    technology capable of achieving 100% recycling and reuse poses a challenge/risk.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    Our focus is on efficient resource usage and optimised packaging without compromising product
                    quality and safety. We address various challenges such as cost management, market competitiveness,
                    consumer safety, and effective water and waste management innovatively. We ensure that our packaging
                    is fit-for-purpose and is made of environmentally friendly or recyclable materials.
                    <br><br>
                    All our beverage manufacturing facilities operate on zero- waste-to-landfill basis, and we are
                    actively implementing an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Plan. This plan aims to collect and
                    recycle the equivalent (or more than) of 100% of the packaging used across our Beverages, Foods, and
                    RTD divisions.

                    Product stewardship plays a crucial role in meeting consumers' increasing demands for
                    sustainability-related information, such as packaging materials and waste management practices.
                    Failing to address these could subject TCPL to potential legal liabilities, reputational damage,
                    increased waste, and costs, as well as loss of consumer trust and market share. Incorporating
                    stringent quality standards into our product range eliminates or minimises potential health and
                    safety hazards, thereby helping in reducing financial and reputational risks.

                    As consumer preferences and market trends evolve rapidly, maintaining a strong and responsive
                    consumer connect programme helps us identify changing demand patterns and preferences. This allows
                    the company to innovate and adapt its product portfolio. It could create cost efficiencies by
                    reducing waste in producing products that have low demand and focusing on higher-margin, high-demand
                    offerings. Moreover, a strong consumer connect reduces the risk of reputational damage by providing
                    channels for direct feedback and appropriate grievance redressal.

                    Ultimately, a disconnect with consumers could result in a loss of market share to competitors.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    Upholding human rights has significant positive impact on TCPL's stakeholders. Suppliers
                    and partners appreciate the company's commitment to human rights, which fosters trust and
                    strengthens relationships. Consumers prefer businesses that respect human rights, leading to greater
                    brand loyalty and positive positioning. Investors benefit from human rights compliance as it reduces
                    the risk of reputational damage, boycotts, or legal issues that could impact financial returns.
                    Additionally, high standards around human rights improve TCPL's standing with regulators and society
                    at large, demonstrating the company's dedication to social responsibility and contributing to
                    broader human rights objectives nationally and internationally.
