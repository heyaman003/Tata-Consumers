            <p class="fs-5">At TCPL, we are committed to upholding our role as
                a responsible enterprise delivering long-term value
                to our stakeholders. We take pride in our product offerings and brands that consumers trust, as also the
                way we operate - underpinned by environmental and social conscientiousness, regulatory compliance, and
                uncompromising integrity. Our governance is steered by explicit processes and policies that drive
                transparency and accountability across all levels of our organization. The foundation of our governance
                lies in the Tata Code of Conduct, which integrates learnings from over a century of operations, our
                global geographic presence, diversified businesses and evolving international best practices; it also
                aligns with our growth objectives and vision. </p>

            <p class="fs-5">
                Our ESG governance exemplifies participation and responsibility across all levels, starting with the
                Board's CSR and Sustainability Committee at the top.
                A Steering Committee manages the execution of our sustainability strategy and is tasked with
                initializing CSR & Sustainability initiatives across our operations. The Steering Committee also
                identifies new initiatives, supports in risk management, and allocates resources for promoting
                sustainability. Our governance structure
                is further comprised of working groups that correspond with each pillar of our sustainability strategy,
                such as the Nutrition Committee, Business & Human Rights Committee and the Sustainable Operations
                committee.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">
                The Internal Audit and Risks team at Tata Consumer also holds a significant role in our ESG agenda. This
                team is responsible for the oversight of the organization's risk management process, which thoroughly
                integrates ESG risks into our organizational risk matrix. Following this, appropriate mitigation actions
                are identified and enacted. Residual risk is thereby reduced to an acceptable level and continuously
                monitored.

                        micronutrient-rich products, we created Tata Tea Gold Vita Care, a new product enriched with
                        four vital vitamins. According to the meta-analysis conducted, the highest occurrence
                        of micronutrient deficiency was found in Vitamin D (61%), trailed by Vitamin B12 deficiency
                        (53%) and folic acid deficiency (37%). TCPL chose to enrich tea with Vitamin D and Vitamins B6,
                        B9, and B12, that are known for supporting maintenance of normal bone health, aiding in reducing
                        tiredness and fatigue, supporting normal blood formation, and facilitating normal
                        energy-yielding metabolism. The methodology adopted by TCPL guarantees that each 2 gram serving
                        contains 15% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of these micronutrients.

                        water/milk without impacting the tea's taste, thus maintaining the familiar experience of
                        consuming regular tea. Tata Tea Gold Vita Care creates a soothing sensory experience while
                        delivering a nutrient-rich brew. The sophisticated blend of antioxidants, vitamins, and natural

                        Currently, supplier screening is conducted systematically by our Internal Quality team, who
                        physically audit the supplier facilities based on
                        TCPL's Food Safety Standards. Vendors are scored based on the audit findings and root cause
                        analyses (RCA); implementation of corrective and preventive action plans (CAPA), jointly
                        developed for addressing identified gaps, are verified periodically. The approval of the vendor
                        is based on the scores achieved, and a report is provided to each vendor once the process is
                        concluded. In terms of the ESG aspects, we ensure that all our strategic suppliers, those
                        involved in primary packaging, possess ISO and BRC certifications.
                        This serves as the initial level of screening and

                            We define a critical supplier as one with whom we have a significant value-based business
                            relation from procuring raw materials for our offerings or other related materials like
                            packaging. The other criterion for defining criticality is engagements based on exclusivity
                            of supplies. Our critical supplier base forms a significant component of our value chain and
                            is integral to our business growth and sustainability.

                    At TCPL, our dedication to sustainable sourcing extends to our tea, coffee, water, salt and food
                    offerings. We aspire to base our sourcing on the principles of sustainability and strive to ensure
                    that the supply chain remains true to this value. As a founding member of the Ethical Tea
                    Partnership (ETP), we are committed to creating a vibrant tea industry that upholds social and
                    environmental sustainability.
                    <br><br>
                    Our sustainable sourcing strategy follows a two-pronged approach - the source materials not only
                    need to be sustainable, but should also be produced responsibly. This approach ensures that the
                    resources we use leave a minimal environmental footprint and are produced ethically, adhering to
                    fair labour and manufacturing practices, in line with our long-term sustainability goals.

                            in reducing the emissions associated with long-distance transportation, thus minimising our

                        Additionally, our purchasing practices are systematically assessed to maintain their alignment
                        with the Supplier Code of Conduct. This cycle of continual review allows us to uphold consistent
                        standards of ethical and sustainable behaviour in our interactions
                        with suppliers.

                        To enhance collaborations with our packaging material providers, we have instituted a biannual
                        Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) programme for all
                        our primary packaging suppliers and indirect material suppliers, with the aim of improving cost
                        management, strengthening governance, encouraging innovation and enhancing the visibility of
                        service and performance.
                        The SRM process employs a scoring system based on various performance indicators. This process
                        takes place both on-site and off-site. Whenever Opportunities for Improvement (OFIs) are
                        identified, TCPL suggests action plans for suppliers to enhance scores in the subsequent audit
                        cycles. This continuous feedback and improvement mechanism is a key part of our supplier
                        relationships. Each indicator carries specific weightage: cost at 15%, service at 30%, quality
                        and capability at 30%, and innovation and ethical supply at 25%. In FY 2023-24, we have included
                        34 suppliers from various packaging segments in this SRM initiative.

                            110 units across four regions. This has boosted transparency and traceability in the tea
                            supply chain, improved efficiency of trustea certification, and enhanced brand trust,
                            assuring our customers of ethically sourced, superior-quality tea.

                cover many critical areas, including achieving Net Zero through promotion of energy efficiency and use
                of green energy sources; being resource efficient, aiming for water neutrality and 100% recyclable
                packaging. Our goal is not just to minimise waste, but to aim for zero waste to landfill. Additionally,
                protecting biodiversity and preserving nature form an integral part of this commitment. We are committed
                to continuously looking for better ways to operate in a manner respectful to the planet and its resource

                    At TCPL, we are committed to responsible energy and emissions management across our operations. Our
                    direct emissions stem from the use of fuels like biomass, diesel, petrol, furnace oil, coal, LPG,
                    and kerosene, as well as refrigerants used in our processes. In the reporting year 47% of our direct
                    energy requirement was met by bio-based fuels, such as fire-wood, biomass pellets, spent tea waste,
                    briquettes and husk, reflecting our dedication to environment friendly energy solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    Our indirect energy needs are met through grid electricity. We proactively build capacity and
                    utilise solar power in
                    off-grid mode to meet part of our power requirements. In FY 2023-24, 27% of power demand was met by
                    renewable sources such as wind and solar. We are committed to boosting the share of renewable energy
                    to 35% by
                    FY 2025-26. We also aim to achieve carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions across all
                    regions by
                    FY 2025-26.
                    <br><br>
                    To foster efficiency in our operations, multiple initiatives have been incorporated at our operating
                    locations, including the installation of new multitrack packing machines, LED lights, motor
                    upgrades, and more. This year, we also put out our Energy Conservation Policy and commenced our
                    journey on ISO 50001 certification.

                <h3>CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    To effectively address climate change risks, we have implemented the recommendations of the Task
                    Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') and have adopted a climate risk assessment
                    framework. The core objective of our climate risk assessment framework is to enable the company
                    assess and mitigate both physical and transition risks.
                    <br><br>
                    Major risks under physical and transitional categories have been identified in alignment with the
                    TCFD recommendations. Through a qualitative and quantitative assessment, we have mapped these risks
                    to each business unit at TCPL. We also conducted stakeholder interactions with all the business and
                    department heads to validate these risks through a 4-factor Likert scale.
                    <br><br>
                    Comprehensive mitigation strategies and contingency plans addressing these risks have been
                    seamlessly merged into the company's overarching long-term strategy and Enterprise Risk Management
                    (ERM) framework.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    Prudent use of resources to minimise waste, as well as, safe and scientific disposal of waste
                    generated, remain integral to our manufacturing processes. Our target is to become zero waste
                    to landfill across our entire operations by
                    FY 2025-26. All our beverage factories across the globe have achieved this status already. Expanding
                    on this effort, we are also focusing on managing food loss effectively. Products failing to meet our
                    stringent quality standards or reaching their expiry, are repurposed into animal feed, ensuring a
                    holistic waste management process that does not strain the natural environment. To further this
                    commitment, we collaborate with authorised waste collectors and recyclers, as their support is
                    integral to our waste management endeavours.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    As a part of the sustainability agenda, TCPL undertook Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for tea, it being
                    one of TCPL's major revenue products. The study was conducted as per the ISO 14040/44 standards for
                    a cradle to grave boundary of Tea leaves. It included raw materials supply, upstream transportation,
                    manufacturing process, electricity and fuel consumption within TCPL facility, and packaging of the
                    products, Use Phase and End-of-life (EoL).
                    <br><br>
                    The LCA study has been able to provide directional inputs on our product footprint, especially from
                    a Scope 3 perspective. As an entity with a significant Scope 3 emissions, we have been able to
                    arrive at a materiality analysis on Scope 3 categories for the Business. This materiality outcome
                    has been also independently verified by a 3 party and will help us in bettering our decarbonisation
                    pathways.

                <p class="col-md-6">
                    We aim to become water neutral across geographies by 2030. Water use efficiency and conservation
                    figures prominently in our strategy, given that water is in our products and used in our production
                    processes. With water scarcity being a significant concern in many geographies, assessing and
                    managing water risks is crucial for ensuring the sustainability and resilience of our operations.
                    With this understanding, in FY 2023-24, we have undertaken a detailed water risk assessment to
                    identify opportunities for water efficiency improvements covering all our production operations.

                    practices. This aligns with our overarching goal of adopting a long- term perspective that
                    prioritises the sustainability of our reliance on water resources.
                    <br><br>
                    We have strengthened our water risk resilience by conducting water risk assessments for our
                    Plantations, NourishCo and RTD business segments, using appropriate third-party tools, such as WRI
                    aqueduct, WWF water risk filter, etc.

                    Fostering Water <br>Conservation : <br>Paonta Sahib Plant
                </h2>
                <p class="fs-5 p-4">
                    In our commitment to responsible water consumption, we strive to significantly reduce
                    our water usage ratio continually. Recognising
                    the interconnectedness of water conservation, cost-efficiency, and environmental responsibility, our
                    efforts focus on modifying processes, reusing water, and implementing the 3R formula - Reduce,
                    Reuse, and Recycle. A pivotal starting point in this direction was the modification of the P&ID for
                    the filler rinsing and filling process, minimising water waste from pressure fluctuations and
                    stoppages. We maximised water reuse by collecting, filtering, and redirecting water from rinsing and
                    filling to utility functions, resulting in substantial freshwater savings. All process wastewater
                    was channelled into an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and recycled for supplementary applications
                    like gardening and irrigation, achieving zero treated water discharge. This strategic 3R
                    implementation led to a remarkable improvement in water usage ratio, from 4 to 2.6 L/L, saving
                    approximately 50KL
                    per day and marking a significant stride toward environmental sustainability.

            <div class="row fs-5">
                <p class="col-md-6 p-4">
                    Tetley, Teapigs and Good Earth's large tea production facility in Eaglescliffe, Teesside, England,
                    has been pioneering the transition to sustainable packaging.
                    <br><br>
                    Tetley took on the challenging task of introducing plant-based tissue packaging for tea variants.
                    The new plant-based material identified for use in tea bags, functions at a pace six times slower
                    than traditional materials, leading to issues with packaging efficiency and design. To address this,
                    Tetley's engineers developed a new technology, currently under patenting, to maintain high-speed
                    production using the plant-based tissue. This solution prevents issues such as bag splitting,
                    maintaining both operational efficiency and product quality.
                    <br><br>
                    <b class="fw-bold fs-4">Innovative Packaging Redesign </b>
                    <br><br>
                    Tetley is also redesigning its packaging, introducing a compact, efficient soft-pack design made
                    from recyclable card. The new design eliminates the need for plastic wrap, reduces waste, and is
                    fully recyclable and compostable. Additionally, the new design allows Tetley to keep its product
                    identity for Original, Decaf, Extra Strong and Gold lines.
                </p>
                <div class="col-md-6 ml-4 p-4">
                    <p>
                        The new soft-pack carton design could remove
                        34.6 million pieces of non-recyclable waste, and the conversion of 9bn teabags could eliminate
                        270 tons of oil-based plastic, equivalent to 22 double-decker buses. This would mean conversion
                        of 699 million teabags and elimination of 7.2 million pieces from the waste stream. This project
                        moves Tetley closer to its goal of eliminating single-use plastic and making all packaging
                        compostable by 2025.

                    In FY 2023-24, there were 610 new recruits to our employee pool. TCPL also promotes opportunities
                    for employees to transition across departments, through appropriate skilling. A notable portion of
                    vacant positions are filled through internal transfers, accounting for 25% in FY 2023-24,
                    highlighting the adaptability and preparedness of our employees.
                    <br><br>
                    We are consistently working on enhancing the Diversity and Inclusion aspect of our Recruitment,
                    Retention, and Advancement strategy. We held an Inclusive Hiring workshop, targeted at equipping our
                    human resources business associates and Talent Acquisition team with the necessary skills. In FY
                    2023-24, 18% employees chose to voluntarily leave the organisation comprising 14.8% women and 18.3%
                    men, where as our involuntarily attrition was 4% comprising 6.8% women and 4% men.

                    Our organisation acknowledges the role of trade unions in protecting workers’ rights. 98% of our
                    workforce is represented either by an independent trade union or through collective bargaining
                    agreements. TCPL enjoys a high level of trust among all employee and worker cadres and engages in
                    transparent and fair negotiation process and supports best in class working conditions, benefits,
                    and wages for our employees and workers (including those on contract ). We consistently maintain
                    equal pay for all genders and job roles, also ensuring all employees, including those from our
                    contractors, suppliers, and franchisees, receive a wage as per law of the land that allows them to,
                    at minimum, meet basic needs.

            <p class="col-md-6 fs-4">
                Our annual employee engagement survey serves as a
                valuable tool, offering insights into the organisation's pulse. We actively listen to team members at
                various stages of the employee life cycle. This approach helps us gain valuable feedback, identify areas
                for improvement and enhance the overall employee experience within the organisation. In FY 2023-24, the
                Executive Committee decided to optimise the frequency of surveys, reducing it from twice a year to once,
                with the primary focus shifting to action planning and initiatives that help drive
                engagement.
            </p>
            <p class="col-md-6 fs-4">
                The qualitative and quantitative insight collected through
                the survey are analysed and the feedback is cascaded to employees through Focus Group Discussions, where
                actions are collaboratively decided upon by the teams and their respective people managers. The
                Engagement Index, which is a key parameter of measurement in the survey, for FY 2023-24 is 72. This
                number is an average of Advocacy indicator (employee recommends TCPL as great place to work), Sentiment
                indicator (How happy is the employee at TCPL) and Loyalty indicator (Is the employee feeling valued for
                his/her contribution).

                    At TCPL, all employees are offered diverse avenues for personal growth. We foster continuous
                    learning and development at every level throughout our workforce, utilising both internal and
                    external training channels, both online and offline. Moreover, a broad array of knowledge resources
                    is accessible to address the unique needs and interests of each individual.

            <p class="col-md-6 fs-4">
                We tailor learning solutions to align with the growth goals of both employees and the organisation. Our
                learning interventions are categorised into three types: targeted sessions for key and top talent,
                tailored programs for specific groups, and company-wide initiatives designed in line with the objectives
                and audiences. Additionally,
                we offer access to various learning platforms, including LinkedIn Learning, which supported 15,595 hours
                of learning in FY 2023-24.
                <br><br>
                Investing in training and development leads to beneficial outcomes like better skilling, lower turnover
                rates, reduced costs of external hiring, and a more engaged, committed workforce. On average, TCPL
                dedicated 7.3 hours of training and development per full-time equivalent (FTE) employee. This is
                customised to fit the needs of different management, including junior, middle, and senior/top management
                level. The company has invested approximately INR 8,500 per FTE on these training and development
                initiatives.
                <br><br>
                Our training programs not only enhance employees'
                skill sets but also support their performance and preparedness. They provide a framework for employees
                to chart their professional growth, practise acquired skills in their job roles and are pivotal in
                setting and achieving performance objectives. This directly contributes to more informed and
                comprehensive performance evaluations. Various types of individual performance management assessments
                are employed, through Management by Objectives and agile conversations to ensure continuous feedback.
                Performance reviews are conducted on an annualised basis, ensuring continuous evaluation. As
                an organisation, we prioritise fostering frequent and meaningful conversations, both formal and
                informal,
                to cultivate a culture of high performance. Through
                our Conversation Framework, comprising Performance Planning, Mid-Year Review, Year-End Review, and
                Communication discussions, every employee and manager is encouraged to engage in clear and candid
                dialogues throughout the year. We utilise statistical methods such as the bell-curve methodology to
                assess and distinguish performance, evaluating each employee's alignment with their grade and role
                within the organisation.

                Group's human rights vision, we have instituted a Business
                and Human Rights Policy. The policy denounces all forms of harassment (mental, physical, sexual etc)
                explicitly, displaying zero tolerance towards any form
                of discrimination. It stipulates that any discriminatory behaviour or harassment will be met with

                towards preventing incidents of discrimination and harassment at our workplace and training is provided
                for the same. Oversight of this framework is provided by an Apex Committee, while a dedicated Working
                Committee for Human Rights ensures its implementation at the operational level. The Tata Code of Conduct
                and the Supplier Code of Conduct incorporate provisions for human rights and establish mechanisms for

            Our organisation's steadfast commitment to fostering

            our guiding principle in structuring effective safety measures that seek to protect the integrity of our

            programs, and a commendable safety record. During

            <p class="fs-4 p-4">
                The UN declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets to promote healthy and sustainable millet
                diets. TCPL leveraged this to increase the outreach of millet farming, aiming to drive rural and tribal
                communities towards sustainable, organic millet agriculture. We began with baseline surveys and
                initiating Self-Help Group (SHG) meetings and village gatherings. Tribal and other farming communities
                were educated on topics such as benefits of millets and organic farming among others, through workshops
                and discussions. In five months, we conducted 1,997 Haadi visits, 1024 SHG visits,
                and 120 village meetings, reaching 1782 individuals. We also used community videos and radio programs
                to disseminate information on farming techniques, millet cultivation, and marketing strategies.
                Initially, we analysed 102 soil samples to tailor farming practices
                to soil conditions. We provided farmers with technical support through training on vermicompost,
                'Jeevamritha' preparation, scientific sessions, and exposure visits, focusing on natural farming,
                organic manures, modern equipment, and marketing.
                <br><br>
                TCPL distributed millet seeds to 90 farmers, along with trials of various millet varieties and provided irrigation equipment to 40 farmers from 21 different haadis. Furthermore, the initiative focused on diversifying crops,

                <br><br>
                This program underlines our commitment to sustainable development and long-term prosperity by positively impacting multiple stakeholders, including rural and tribal farmers, consumers, and nature.
